# **EduValut: AI-Augmented Centralized Student Profiling for Digital Record & Achievement for HEIs** (Higher Education Instiutions)

Capstone Group ID: KRGC0283

## **Problem Statement (SIH-ID: 25093\)**

Currently, student achievements and records in colleges and universities are distributed across multiple departments or lost in paper documentation, lacking a centralized digital system for cataloguing academic, co-curricular, and extracurricular activities. This fragmentation creates inefficiencies in record-keeping, limits students' ability to build verified dynamic portfolios, and complicates institutional reporting during audits or accreditation exercises like NAAC.

## **Existing Technology**

Some existing technologies partly address this problem:

* Student Management Systems (ERP, SIS) track academics and attendance but do not comprehensively catalogue extracurricular achievements or generate dynamic portfolios.

* Learning Management Systems (LMS) document course completion but lack holistic student profiles.

* Platforms like Digilocker in India allow secure document storage, but do not enable faculty validation or institution-wide analytics/reporting for student activities.

However, none fully integrate academic, extracurricular, and administrative functions specific to holistic student profiling and institutional analytics.

## **Research Gap to be Filled**

The main research gap is the absence of a single, verified, dynamic digital platform that brings together all forms of student achievements, supports live faculty/admin validation, connects to institutional systems, and enables auto-generation of portfolios and real-time analytics for both students and institutional administrators. Existing solutions fail to provide a unified, verifiable, and analytics-ready view of the student's comprehensive record from entry to graduation.

## **Novelty**

* AI Mock Interviews: The platform provides AI-driven mock interview sessions, simulating real placement or admission interviews with instant feedback on communication, technical knowledge, and soft skills.

* AI-Powered ATS Scoring: Students can upload their resumes along with job descriptions, and the system will use AI to evaluate and score the resumes against the ATS (Applicant Tracking System) criteria. This helps students optimize their profiles and understand how well they match specific job requirements.

* Centralization & Verification: All student activities—academic, curricular, extracurricular—are documented and validated in one place, accessible via web/mobile.

* Dynamic Portfolio: Automated, faculty-verified portfolios downloadable in PDF or via links, ready for placements or admissions.

* Integration-Ready: Platform connects seamlessly with existing ERP, LMS, or digital university platforms using open APIs.

* Event-based Analytics: Institutions can instantly generate customized reports for NAAC, NIRF, AICTE, or internal review.

* Activity Tracker: Intuitive UI for uploading, tracking, and validating every participation or achievement.

* Mentoring Support: Real-time dashboards for faculty to support student guidance and development.

These features modernize existing scattered systems, making them dynamic, integrated, and action-oriented.

## **Feasibility with In-House Facilities**

Yes, development is feasible with standard IT infrastructure:

* Skills Required: Web/Mobile developers (React, Flutter, or similar), backend developers (NodeJS, Django, etc.), database admin (MySQL/PostgreSQL), UI/UX designer, and institutional coordinators.

* Process: Project to proceed through needs assessment, platform design, modular development (dashboard, tracker, analytics, integration), pilot testing, and phased rollout across departments.

* Support: Institutional IT teams can host and manage the system, ensuring privacy and integration with existing ERP/LMS. Development can utilize existing servers/cloud, and institutional digital records as seed data, with periodic training for students and faculty.

## **Expected Outcomes**

* A fully functional centralized platform for cataloguing and validating student achievements, accessible on web and mobile.

* Auto-generated, shareable, verified digital portfolios for every student, supporting placements, admissions, and fellowships.

* Institutional reporting dashboards for instant analytics and compliant data export for audits and accreditation exercises (NAAC, NIRF, AICTE).

* AI-powered ATS resume scoring feature that allows students to upload job descriptions and evaluate how well their resumes match, improving placement readiness.

* Improved student engagement and guidance, with real-time achievement tracking and mentoring support for holistic development.

* AI-powered mock interview feature that helps students practice and receive feedback, enhancing their confidence and preparedness for real interviews.
